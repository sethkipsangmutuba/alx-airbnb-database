# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module. It focuses on implementing advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques on a simulated Airbnb database. Learners gain hands-on experience with database management, query optimization, indexing, and partitioning to handle large-scale applications efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

- Master advanced SQL queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Optimize query performance using tools like EXPLAIN and ANALYZE
- Implement indexing and table partitioning for large datasets
- Monitor and refine database performance
- Develop data-driven design and decision-making skills like a professional DBA

## Project Requirements

- Solid understanding of SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY)
- Familiarity with relational database concepts (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization)
- Basic knowledge of performance monitoring tools (EXPLAIN, ANALYZE)
- Ability to set up and manage a GitHub repository

## Files in this Repository

- `joins_queries.sql` → Contains all SQL queries for joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN)
- `README.md` → Project documentation, explanations, and instructions

## Instructions

Execute the queries in `joins_queries.sql` on the Airbnb database to:

1. Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings (INNER JOIN)
2. Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews (LEFT JOIN)
3. Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user (FULL OUTER JOIN)

## Notes

- Make sure to include `ORDER BY` clauses in your queries where applicable to pass the project auto-check.
- The SQL queries are meant to demonstrate advanced joins and proper relational database querying practices.
